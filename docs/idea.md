🍄 Mycelial Empire
A biological simulation game where you play as a sentient fungal colony expanding beneath the forest floor.

Nodes: Represent Junctions, Resource Pockets (Water, Carbon, Nutrients), and Points of Interest (Ancient Roots, Rival Colonies).

The Heart (Core Node): Your starting point. All resources must eventually flow back here.

Resource Pockets (Generators): Once connected, they passively "leech" resources from the soil.

Junctions (Transformers): Can be upgraded to "process" resources. For example, combine Water + Carbon into Sugar (a more efficient energy source).

Edges: Represent Hyphae (the fungal threads). Growing them costs resources.

Idle Mechanic: Connected nodes automatically extract resources and send them flowing through the network back to the Heart.

Player's Role:

Expand: Spend Sugar to grow new hyphae (edges) to explore the hidden map and discover new resource nodes.

Specialize: Upgrade nodes. An "Absorber" node might be upgraded to "Water Specialist" to draw 300% more water but stop absorbing everything else.

Defend: You might encounter "Toxic" soil nodes that damage your hyphae, or "Rival Colonies" that compete for resources. You must route around them or develop "Enzyme" upgrades to overcome them.

The Graph Twist:

Flow & Pressure: The graph is a literal flow network. If a single edge (hyphae) is trying to carry too many resources, it "clogs" and the flow rate for the entire branch drops. Players must build redundant paths and wider "main" branches.

Decay: Edges cost a small amount of Sugar/sec to maintain. An inefficient, sprawling network will collapse under its own weight. This forces optimization.

Prestige: "Fruiting." When your network is massive, you can trigger a "Fruiting" event (grow a mushroom). This resets your network but grants Spores, which are used in an evolution-style skill tree for permanent bonuses (e.g., "Hyphae grow 2x faster," "Unlock 'Toxin Resistance' node").
