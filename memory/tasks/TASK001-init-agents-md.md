# TASK001 - Initialize AGENTS.md

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-11-14  
**Updated:** 2025-11-14

## Original Request

User command: `/init an AGENTS.md`

## Thought Process

- Repository mandates the Spec-Driven workflow; therefore AGENTS.md must codify how agents interact with requirements, designs, and memory artifacts.
- Requirements (R1–R4) in `memory/requirements.md` define profile, workflow, reference, and onboarding expectations.
- Design doc `memory/designs/DES001-agents-doc.md` lays out sections, templates, and data flow for the markdown deliverable.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Bootstrap document scaffolding** — Create context, change log, and navigation anchors referencing Spec-Driven workflow.
2. **Author agent profiles** — Use the template from DES001; cover at least Builder, Research, Reviewer personas with missions, guardrails, and references.
3. **Describe collaboration workflow** — Tie to Analyze→Design→Implement→Validate→Reflect→Handoff phases plus memory touchpoints.
4. **Define onboarding & operations checklist** — Provide actionable steps, command guardrails, and escalation paths.
5. **Add reference matrix + update instructions for future agents** — Table of resources + process for contributions.

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
